      <p>Welcome.</p>
      <p>There's a role you're built for in shaping the future we want to live into.</p>
      <p>You may already sense it — that feeling that you're meant to contribute in a specific way, even if you haven't fully stepped into it yet.</p>
      <p>This is a way to bring that into focus.</p>
      <p>We'll move through a few focused questions to surface the pattern — and then we'll test it carefully. Not as an idea, but as something that either resonates in your bones or doesn't.</p>
      <p>If it fits, you'll leave with clarity about your Purpose Piece — and a clear path for inhabiting it more fully.</p>
      <p>There are no right answers.<br>Don't choose what sounds impressive.<br>Choose what feels most like you when you're not trying to be anything.</p>
